# Tip Calculator

## Software Summary

Only using Python, this software will take a user's answers to some questions and provide them the tip amount and total bill that a meal will cost them.

## Built With

* Python 3.11

## Version History 

**Version 1.0**  
*4/21/2024*  
* Program is done (for now).
* I noticed that the decimal places, when the dollar amounts end in ".00", will only display one "0" instead of two (at least, in the Python IDLE); I may need to look into that further.
* Other than that, the math seems to be accurate.

**Version 0.1**  
*4/20/2024*  
* This program has just been started.
